# Project2PetitSohnREPO
Repository for project 2 files and reports written by Adam Sohn and Paul Petit

In this project, we analyze the relationship between home affordability, eviction, wage, time, and other variables. 
More specifically, we set a guiding list of questions to test our economic intuitions (our hypotheses) 
in these markets to glean insights that make sense of a rich nationwide housing price and eviction dataset. 

Questions

(1) How does regional home affordability relate to regional rental affordability?

(2) How does eviction rate change with cost of rent?
